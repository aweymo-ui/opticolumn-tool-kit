The Opticolumn Tool Kit is a series of scripts developed to embed more accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) into a wide variety of archival documents.

**My goals in developing this OCR kit continue to be:**

- Implementing free, open-source models for sustainability.
- Ensuring these models don't require an API login or tokens, and run locally after their initial download, for data privacy.
- Achieving a significant improvement in the accuracy of both typed and handwritten text materials.
- Keeping file size growth relatively minimal (5–15 percent) with the addition of the OCR layer.
- Ensuring that processed files meet the WCAG definition of "programmatic text".
- Avoiding all text recognition models that have demonstrated a vulnerability to hallucination.
- Making the kit freely available to other institutions facing similar challenges.

The Opticolumn Tool Kit includes the following resources and applications:

- [Opticolumn](https://github.com/Scholarly-Projects/opticolumn)
    - Intended for archival scans and designed for type, handwritten text, cursive or a combination of all three. The tool can handle unorthodox arrangements of text, such as annotations and marginalia, but its reading order arrangement is not as developed as the following script.
- [Opticolumns](https://github.com/Scholarly-Projects/opticolumns)
    - Intended for archival scans of large-scale, multi-columned materials, such as newspapers.
- [Opticolumn_Editor](https://github.com/Scholarly-Projects/opticolumn_editor)
    - Creates OCR using Opticolumn and produces a CSV of the OCR text that can be edited and processed again to incorporate copy edits into the final embedded layer. This method is recommended if you need OCR that surpasses the 85–95% accuracy benchmarks of Opticolumn and Opticolumns.
- _Forthcoming_:
    - An Optical Music Recognition tool, to make the library's International Jazz Collection and digitized sheet music fully accessible.

_Step-by-step instructions for installing and running these scripts are included in each tool's setup.md file._

The Opticolumn Tool Kit was developed while overhauling the [University of Idaho Library's](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/) [digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) to make the collection more discoverable and accessible. The development of the original [Opticolumn](https://github.com/Scholarly-Projects/opticolumn) tool is written about in greater detail in [_Transparent Practices: OCR and AI in the Archives_](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15501906261439241) by Rebecca Hastings and Andrew Weymouth, _Collections: A Journal for Museum and Archives Professionals_, June 2026.
